This is a free test set for comparing plagiarism detection software.
 More will be added soon.

## Contribution

I would love to add your own test sets here, so don't hesitate to commit them.

### Process
 Just create a new directory for each test set, describe it shortly in this
 README and send a pull request.
 A single test set should include one directory with the original source code
 plus a number of directories containing clones, with or without obfuscation.
 Clone types are determined using the categorization by [Roy et al.] [1]
