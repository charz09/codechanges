This module is called CMT219 and is taken by lots of students. There are over 130 of them. One of them is called 007, just like James Bond.

This is a test text file  that contains numbers. We want to make sure that the number 0 is picked up. But also numbers such as 4, 55, 8726 and 43.

The final test is to find the number hidden in the the following word: Matt563hew.
